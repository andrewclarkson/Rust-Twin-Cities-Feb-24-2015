# Monthly Rust Twin Cities: February 24, 2015

This is a presentation given to the Rust Twin Cities Meetup at their February 24, 2015 meeting.

#Disclaimer

This talk was given by a amature Rusticorn (Rustacean?, Rusticator?) and no doubt contains amature explanations and possibly errors, luckily you can [lodge issues](https://github.com/bitborn/rust-twin-cities-feb-24-2015/issues) and submit pull requests to fix my mistakes!

Though it is likely fairly obvious this presentation does not reflect the opinions of The Rust Project or Mozilla. :)
